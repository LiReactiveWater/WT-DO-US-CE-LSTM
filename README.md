# *DeepWater*: deep learning for water quality 
<img src="logo/DeepWater_logo.png" alt="Logo" align="left" height="280" />

The ***DeepWater*** is a flexible, scalable, and explainable deep learning (DL) model to predict riverine water quality. The model is designed to predict spatio-temporal dynamics of water quality at the large scale (e.g., hundreds of rivers) for decades. The model is developed based on *HydroDL* (a hydrology DL model) to focus on water quality, with expanding capacities of handling sparse data and large data gaps, flexible splitting schemes (e.g., based on the data distribution of each basins), multi-task prediction (e.g., concentration and flux of multiple solutes), and model interpretability for input importance. 

By leveraging the power of big data and deep learning, the ***DeepWater*** aims to improve our ability to better model and understand water quality for decadal trends, seasonal patterns, and daily variations under diverse and changing hydro-climate conditions.
